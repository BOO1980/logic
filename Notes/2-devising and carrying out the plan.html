	<h1>Step 2 - devising and carrying out the plan</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>If the current problem resemebles a problem you have seen before, write down how it is similar</li>
		<li>Write down how the problem differs from any of the previous</li>
		<li>For those aspects that are similar, can you use the same solution techniques that you used in the past</li>
		<li>Most programming tasks will usually compromise of a number of smaller subproblems</li>
		<li>some subprobkems may be eaiser to solve than others</li>
		<li>Start with eaiser tasks and they may give clues to how to do the other tasks</li>
		<li>In understanding a problem, a drawing or sketch or alternative description of the problem may help</li>
		<li>Solve problem<ul>
			<li>Providing your program with the data it needs</li>
			<li>processing the data</li>
			<li>Displaying the results of saving them to file</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Exploring processing the data problem will likely yeild a further set of subproblems</li>
		<li>Make a drawing, sketch or an alternative description to the problem</li>
		<li>retelling a problem in your own words to another person is also affective</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Step 3 - carrying out the attack</h1>
	<ul><li>Once you understand the solution you need to write down the sequence of actions necessary to solve the problem</li>
		<li>You need to ask yourself does the order rely on certain conditions to be trye</li>
		<li>If you are finding it too complicated to understand a problem , try removing some details to see if simlifiyinf gives you a clear understanding</li>
		<li>Once yoou have a sequence of actions, check whether they all need to be carried out in all cicumstances, perhaps some actions only need to be carried out in all circumstances</li>
		<li>perhaps some of the actions only need to be carried out when certain conditions met</li>
		<li>Is it sufficient to carry out each action just once, or does some actions needs to be repeated</li>
		<li>sleeping on a problem can help, or take a walk if you find your self stuck</li>
