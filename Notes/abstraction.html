	-Abstraction happens when we view something in general terms without concentrating on the concrete detils
	-Allows you to ignore all the fine details that would otherwise overwhelm us
	-Allows you to manage an otherwise unmanagable amount of information
	-Programmers use abstraction as a way of simplifying and managing details
	-At some point the detail will need to be considered
	-Part of being a programmer is learning how to juggle abstractions, ignoring the dine detail until its approriate to do so
	-Algorithms control and manipulate data in order to produce desired results

QUESTION
1) How would you describe the items in your wallet using three different levels of abstraction (low: as many details as you can think of, medium; the main pointsl; and high: identifying characteristics only)
2) Put on my shoes is a highly abstract description of a common taksk (to describe the task at a lower level of abstraction requires some detail to be known.  Jot down some information that are needed to be able to describe step-by-step the process of putting on a pari of shoes)
