	-Abstraction happens when we view something in general terms without concentrating on the concrete detils
	-Allows you to ifnore all the fine details that would otherwise overwhelm us
	-Allows you to manage an otherwise unmanagable amount of information
	-Programmers use abstraction as a way of simplifying and managing details
	-At some point the detail will need to be considered
	-Part of being a programmer is learning how to juggle abstractions, ignoring the dine detail until its approriate to do so
	-Algorithms control and manipulate data in order to produce desired results
