	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<ul><li>
		Most problems can be solved in a number of ways and it is not always clear which way is better
	</li>
	<li>Our goal as software professionals is to provide high-quality software solutions, we want to use a method of processing from problems specification to high quality software solution in a resonable manner</li>
	<li>A problem solving stratergy provides a framework within which you are more likely to arrive at a good solution</li>
	<li>It is foolish to answer a question that you do not understand</li>
	<li>Part of learning to think like a programmer involves reflecting upon what we have done</li>
	<li>writing down the problem is even more useful, as to write something down you must first understand it</li>
	<li>Sometime in the future other programmers may need to pick up th eocde and modify it. called software maintenance</li>
	<li>As professioanls we must strive to ensure that our program is easy to understand</li>
	

	<h2>stages of problem solving</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>1)Understand the problem</li>
		<li>2)Devise a plan to solve the problem</li>
		<li>3)Carry out a plan</li>
		<li>4)Look back (check the result and reflect up it)</li>
		<li>5)Describe what we have learned from the process</li>
		<li>6)Explain our results(and document our program)</li>
	</ol>
