Programming over-view
	-Before the computer can carry out tasks we must first tell it how to perform them
	-We first solve the proble of deciding how the task is to be carried out
	-We then need to express the solution in a form that can be turned into something that the computer can interpret, without doing this well we cannot progress to feeding the information into the computer
	-A computer is nothing more than a sequence of instructions to tell the machin to do something specific
	-A computer program is just like a recipe
	-A musical score is a bit liek a program too.  
		-Over hundreds of years musicians and composers have developed formatlized lanaguages of notation that allows musical instruments to be communicated on paper
		-A music score idicates the notes to be played
		-duration of the notes
		-volumes of the nores
		-Sections of the score can be marked ofr repititon
		-other marks tell the musician to
			-speed up
			-slow down
			-pause
			-play louder
			-play more softly
	 - what is needed by the novice programmer before all else in an understanding of the process involved in examining and analyzing problems, 
	 	in understanding the comoponent pars of a problem 
	 	and understanding what is required
	 - You need to check your solution for:
	 	mistakes
	 	limitations
	 	inconsitencies
 	-You must be able to write down your plan for soliving the problem in such a way that your soltuon can be repeatedly applied to the problem  even when some of its values are altered
 	-There is little use trying to write programs in programming lanagugae code if you do not first know how to solive the underlying problem
 	- To think like a programmer can be approached in 3 stages
 		-Problem understand and problem solving
 		-Writing solutions in a structured form (algorithms)
 		-Writing algorithms in a programming language

 	wITH Porramming it i s vital to spend the majority of our time thinking about the program and designing a solution to it
 	-One of the last stages of programming is turning on the computer typing in asnd running the program

 		Why
	-Authors like to use computers to help with jpob of typing in and laying out text
	-Scientist and mathematicians use computer to calculate the answers to complex probelms
	-Mussicians and composes use the signal processing capabilities of computers to manipulate sound
	-good programmer should always assume at some time in the future another programmer will need to pick up our programs and modify them
	- the act of chanhing a program after it has been finished is called software maintenance and it is estimated to consumer 70% and 90% of the total cost of the software system
	-system maintenance is to remove erros that were not spotted during development
	-another reason is to update the software to increase its capabilities or make it compatiable with OS
	-as professionals we should ensure our program is easy to understand

	QUESTIONS
	1) what is a program (give your answer in no more than thirty words, how would you explain to someone with limited tech experience what a program is)
	2) Learning to write Java/C/Visual Basic programming language of your choice is not the same as learning to program why not?
	3) What were the cause of the first world war
