Programming over-view
	-Before the computer can carry out tasks we must first tell it how to perform them
	-We first solve the proble of deciding how the task is to be carried out
	-We then need to express the solution in a form that can be turned into something that the computer can interpret, without doing this well we cannot progress to feeding the information into the computer
	-A computer is nothing more than a sequence of instructions to tell the machin to do something specific
	-A computer program is just like a recipe
	-A musical score is a bit liek a program too.  
		-Over hundreds of years musicians and composers have developed formatlized lanaguages of notation that allows musical instruments to be communicated on paper
		-A music score idicates the notes to be played
		-duration of the notes
		-volumes of the nores
		-Sections of the score can be marked ofr repititon
		-other marks tell the musician to
			-speed up
			-slow down
			-pause
			-play louder
			-play more softly
	 - what is needed by the novice programmer before all else in an understanding of the process involved in examining and analyzing problems, 
	 	in understanding the comoponent pars of a problem 
	 	and understanding what is required
	 - You need to check your solution for:
	 	mistakes
	 	limitations
	 	inconsitencies
 	-You must be able to write down your plan for soliving the problem in such a way that your soltuon can be repeatedly applied to the problem  even when some of its values are altered
 	-There is little use trying to write programs in programming lanagugae code if you do not first know how to solive the underlying problem
 	- To think like a programmer can be approached in 3 stages
 		-Problem understand and problem solving
 		-Writing solutions in a structured form (algorithms)
 		-Writing algorithms in a programming language

 	wITH Porramming it i s vital to spend the majority of our time thinking about the program and designing a solution to it

 		Why
	-Authors like to use computers to help with jpob of typing in and laying out text
	-Scientist and mathematicians use computer to calculate the answers to complex probelms
	-Mussicians and composes use the signal processing capabilities of computers to manipulate sound
