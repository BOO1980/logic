	<h1>3.1 Natural Languages and Respresentation</h1>
	<h2>Natural Language</h2>
	<ul><li>Natural Language is our main form of communciation and it comes so naturally to most of us that we use words to describe and explain most things</li>
	<li>Much information content of our conversations and other interactions comes from the way we stress and inflect words and the way we change our expression and move parts of out body</li>
	<li>The natural language can be imprecise and ambiguous</li>
	<li>Computers are neither of these things and to program them we need to be very clear in our thinking and expressions</li>
	<li>In order to write good solutions our understanding of the problem needs to be clear and precise otherwise we might very well solve the wrong problem</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Errors of the third kind</h2>
	<ul><li>An error of the third kind is a computer program that is extremeley well written, easily maintained, efficient, quick, accurate but does not do what the customer asked</li></ul>
	<h2>Diagrams, pictures, visual thinking</h2>
	<ul><li>Often we use forms of representation that will give us clearer insights</li>
