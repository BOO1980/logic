	Panagrams are holoalphabetic - words or sentances that contain every letter in the alphabet
	Here is a famous one used by computers to show how text looks in different forms
		the quick brown dog jumps over the lazy dog
	Panagrams are useful in digitial typography because they demonstrate all the letters in a font withing a more meaningful context then just writing the alaphabet

	The perfect panagram is isogrammatic,  that is is uses each letter only once
	Here are some more panagrams with their letter count shown in parenthesis

	Pack my box with fice dozen liquor jugs (32 e,i and o are repeated)
	waltz, bad nymph for quick jigs vex (only a and i are repeated but not as meaningful)
	siz plump boys guzzled cheap raw vodka quite joyfully
	Quick waxy bugs jump the frozen veldt
	Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox
